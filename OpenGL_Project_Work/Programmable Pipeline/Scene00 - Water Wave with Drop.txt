1.Water drop: 	Water drop is implemented by using Bullet Physics. Also, it contains 2 lights.
		I. Bullet Physics is used to provide translation by giving gravity and mass values.
		II. Scaling and sin() for Wobble Effect is used for Sphere to look like a drop.		
		III. Lights used - Phong ADS light and diffuse light.
 
2.Water Wave: 	Water wave is implemented on Mesh with Height Map and Normal Map using Frame Buffer Object. 
		I. Force equation is used in Height Map calculation.
		II. Normal Map is calculated as per Height Map texture.
		III. To display drop on mesh, drop radius, position and height map are used.
		IV. Above all texture calculations done in Frame Buffer Object. 
		IV. "ASTROMEDICOMP" texture is attached to a quad.
		V. Water mesh is placed on top of quad. Finally, we can see the wave because of Frame Buffer Object.
